PICARA
	Steps in the analysis
		1. Identify GWAS signals for flowering time in maize
		2. Look at LD around the SNPs to get a list of genes
		3. Integrate data 
			3.1 apriori gene list
				3.1.1 Compara of Arabidopsis vs Maize
				3.1.2 Include GO information
				3.1.3 Include PO information
			3.2 Find intersection of genes based on gwas and apriori
			3.3 Probabilistic analytical pipeline
